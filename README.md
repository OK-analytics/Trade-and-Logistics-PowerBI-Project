# \# Trade \& Logistics: End-to-End Business Analysis



A comprehensive Power BI project analyzing the full lifecycle of a retail business — from sales and logistics to payments and customer satisfaction.



\## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to transform raw transactional data into a strategic tool for decision-making. I developed a 4-page interactive dashboard that covers key business verticals, allowing stakeholders to identify bottlenecks and growth opportunities.



\##⚡Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) \& Business Insights

Below are the core metrics developed to measure performance and identify growth opportunities.



\### 📊 1. Sales \& Revenue Performance

\*\* Sales \& Revenue Performance (The "How much?" perspective)\*\*

&nbsp;\* Gross Merchandise Value (GMV): Monitored the total value of merchandise sold to track overall business scale.

&nbsp;\* Average Order Value (AOV): Calculated the average spend per transaction to understand customer purchasing power.

&nbsp;\* Revenue vs. LY (Last Year): \[Custom Metric] Implemented Year-over-Year analysis to identify growth trends and seasonal peaks.

&nbsp;\* Lead-to-Deal Conversion: Evaluated the efficiency of the sales funnel by tracking potential leads versus closed transactions.



\### 📦 2. Operational \& Logistics Efficiency

\*\* Operational \& Logistics Efficiency (The "How fast?" perspective)\*\*

&nbsp;\* Order Fulfillment Rate: Analyzed the funnel from "Approved" to "Shipped" and "Delivered" (achieving a 97.66% successful delivery rate).

&nbsp;\* Delivery Lead Time: Measured the average time from order placement to customer receipt to optimize carrier performance.

&nbsp;\* Shipping Bottleneck Identification: Visualized stages where orders stall to improve supply chain velocity.



\### 💳 3. Payment Dynamics \& Cash Flow

\*\* Payment Dynamics \& Cash Flow (The "How paid?" perspective)\*\*

&nbsp;\* Payment Mix Analysis: Identified that Credit Cards drive nearly 74% of total revenue, followed by Boleto and Vouchers.

&nbsp;\* Average Installment Rate: \[Custom Metric] Tracked the average number of installments (2.85) to assess credit-driven buying behavior.

&nbsp;\* Voucher Impact Tracking: Measured the volume of transactions using vouchers to evaluate the effectiveness of loyalty programs.



\### 😊 4. Customer Experience \& Quality Control

\*\* Customer Experience \& Quality Control (The "How happy?" perspective)\*\*

&nbsp;\* Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): Visualized the Average Review Score (4.09/5) to monitor overall brand health.

&nbsp;\* Negative Feedback Ratio: \[Custom Metric] Calculated the percentage of 1-star and 2-star reviews (14.7%) to pinpoint service or product failures.

&nbsp;\* Response Time Analysis: Measured the correlation between response time and customer ratings to improve service levels.





\## 🛠️ Technical Skills \& Tools



&nbsp;\*\* Data Modeling \& DAX:\*\*

&nbsp;  \* Developed complex Data Models and authored DAX measures to calculate custom KPIs (e.g., Year-over-Year growth, RFM scores, and moving averages).

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;\*\* Data Transformation (Power Query):\*\*

&nbsp;  \* Performed ETL processes to clean and reshape raw data, ensuring high data quality for metrics like Order Fulfillment rate and Delivery Lead Times.

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;\*\* Advanced Visualizations:\*\*

&nbsp;  \* Designed interactive reports with advanced filtering, bookmarks, and tooltips to provide deep dives into Category Performance and Customer Geography.
